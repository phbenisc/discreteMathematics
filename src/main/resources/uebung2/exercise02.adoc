Suppose that a password for a computer system must have at least 8, but no more than 12, characters,
where each character in the password is a lowercase English letter, an uppercase English letter, a digit, or
one of the six special characters ∗,>,<, !,+, and =. Each character may occur multiple times.
a) How many different passwords are available for this computer system?
b) How many of these passwords contain at least one occurrence of at least one of the six special characters?
c) Using your answer to part (a), determine how long it takes a hacker to try every possible password,
assuming that it takes one nanosecond (10^−9^ seconds) for a hacker to check each possible password.
